  Do not edit `app/` while doing security review, governance, feature planning,
  architecture docs, or playbook work.

- Do not add dependencies.

## Review expectations

- Show diffs before applying changes.
- Explain what files you read before giving a repo-grounded answer.
- If a claim is not visible in the files you read, say that clearly.
